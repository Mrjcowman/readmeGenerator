This CLI application allows the user to generate a professional README.md file for any github project by following a series of simple prompts related to the project. It dynamically generates sections of the readme based on the information given to make it a fit for any type of Full-Stack programming project. This README.md, as well as genREADME.md, are both generated using this generator.
